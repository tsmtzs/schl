\begin{document}
\maketitle

\verb|schl| is a \XeLaTeX\, package that provides commands and environments suitable for document types that appear in a classroom enviromnent. It's development is based on the Greek school educational practice, but it may be usefull in other contexts also. This document offers a quick view of working examples for \verb|schl|'s marcos. 

We load the package with the option \verb|english|:

\begin{center}
\verb|\usepackage[english]{schl}|
\end{center}

In this way several macros will be printed in English. These are
defined in \verb|languages/schl-english.def|. Currently, the package
supports the options \verb|english| and \verb|greek|. Option \verb|greek| is more complete.

To set the macros of the package in a different language, start by copying the \verb|languages/schl-template.def| file. Rename it as \verb|languages/schl-<other-language>.def|. Then, set the macros and modify accordingly the \verb|schl.dtx| file.

A list of examples follows.
